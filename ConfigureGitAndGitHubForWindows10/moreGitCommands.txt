Demonstrating usage of git clone
---------------------------------

Difference between git init and git clone:
Both these commands are used to initialize new repositories. But git clone first calls git init to create a new empty repository. 
It then copies the data from the existing repository, and checks out a new set of working files. 

indranid@N-CNU416B8WC MINGW32 ~/Documents/Repos
$ git clone https://github.com/indro8307/GitAndGitHub.git
Cloning into 'GitAndGitHub'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 18, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (18/18), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.
remote: Total 18 (delta 4), reused 14 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (18/18), 4.78 KiB | 30.00 KiB/s, done.

The above command creates a local repository of the existing central repository hosted in GitHub, called 'GitAndGitHub'.
So basically it will create a directory by the name 'GitAndGitHub' in the local system. Apart from other files, it will also have 
a folder called .git containing metadata.
